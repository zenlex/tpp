BNF Grammar for Time
Exercise from 'The Pragmatic Programmer' by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt

<time> := <hour part><minute part>[am/pm]

<hour part> := range 00-24
<minute part> := range 00-59



***brainstorming******

- how do you specify when am/pm is required in this format? 
- how do you specify range in BNF
- can you reqire things based on logic - eg if we're not in military time than  the am/pm param is required?
